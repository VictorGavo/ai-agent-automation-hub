# Agent Quick Start Guide

## Before Starting ANY Task
1. Read this file completely (2 minutes)
2. Check current_priorities.md for project focus
3. Scan relevant sections below based on task type

## Task Type â†’ Required Reading
- **Code Changes**: coding_standards.md + workflow_process.md
- **Database Work**: architecture.md + security_rules.md  
- **Testing**: coding_standards.md (testing section)
- **Documentation**: communication.md + workflow_process.md
- **Any Blocking Issues**: communication.md (escalation section)

## Core Principles (Never Violate These)
- Maximum 4 hours per task
- Ask for clarification if unsure (don't guess)
- Report progress every 30 minutes during work
- Escalate if blocked >15 minutes
- 100% test pass rate required
- Human approval required for all merges

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Starting work without reading task specification completely
- Making assumptions about unclear requirements
- Working beyond 4-hour limit without breaking down task
- Forgetting to update documentation when modifying functionality

## 🔄 Communication Workflow

### Typical Task Execution Flow
1. **Initialize** - Task status set to IN_PROGRESS with 0% progress
2. **Progress Updates** - Regular status updates with current step and percentage
3. **Clarification (if needed)** - Automatic escalation for unclear requirements
4. **Completion** - Final report with PR URL, test results, and quality metrics
5. **Error Handling** - Automatic escalation with priority-based routing

### Priority Escalation Matrix
| Error Type | Recovery Attempts | Priority Level |
|------------|------------------|----------------|
| `security_violation` | Any | Critical |
| `github_api_auth` | Any | Critical |
| `database_connection` | Any | Critical |
| Any error | 3+ attempts | High |
| Any error | 1-2 attempts | Medium |
| First occurrence | 0 attempts | Low |

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Status Update
```python
await client.update_task_status(
    task_id="task-123",
    status=TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS,
    progress_percentage=45,
    current_step="Generating Flask routes"
)
```

### Clarification Request
```python
await client.request_clarification(
    task_id="task-123",
    questions=["Should the API require authentication?"],
    priority=NotificationPriority.MEDIUM,
    context={"endpoint": "/api/users"}
)
```

### Completion Report
```python
await client.report_completion(
    task_id="task-123",
    pr_url="https://github.com/repo/pull/42",
    test_results={"tests_passed": 15, "tests_failed": 1},
    artifacts={"generated_files": ["app.py", "models.py"]}
)
```

### Error Escalation
```python
await client.escalate_error(
    task_id="task-123",
    error_type="github_api_auth",
    error_message="Authentication failed",
    recovery_attempts=2,
    context={"api_endpoint": "/repos/user/project"}
)
```

## 🎖️ Quality Features

### Communication Statistics
- **Updates sent** - Total status updates delivered
- **Clarifications requested** - Number of human interventions needed
- **Completions reported** - Successful task completions
- **Errors escalated** - Issues requiring human attention
- **Health status** - Overall communication system health

### Quality Scoring Algorithm
```python
base_score = (tests_passed / total_tests) * 80
bonus_points = 0
if code_coverage > 80: bonus_points += 10
if lint_score > 8: bonus_points += 10
final_score = min(100, base_score + bonus_points)
```

### Error Priority Logic
```python
def determine_priority(error_type, recovery_attempts):
    if error_type in ["github_api_auth", "database_connection", "security_violation"]:
        return CRITICAL
    elif recovery_attempts >= 3:
        return HIGH
    elif recovery_attempts >= 1:
        return MEDIUM
    else:
        return LOW
```
